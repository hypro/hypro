The C++ library HyPro, which is a result of the project HyPro funded by the german research council, provides easy to
use implementations of state set representations for the reachability analysis of
hybrid systems via flowpipe-construction. It provides implementations of the most commonly used state set
representations such as boxes, convex polytopes, support functions or zonotopes. All
implementations conform to the same general interface, which allows the user to easily switch between representations (
even during analysis).

Additionally, commonly used data-structures and algorithms required during the analysis are provided. The tool features
a parser for Flow*-syntax and implementations of basic reachability analysis
methods based on flowpipe-construction.

On the [official project page](https://ths.rwth-aachen.de/research/projects/hypro/) you can find a collection of
benchmarks as well.
