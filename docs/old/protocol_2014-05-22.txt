1) Initial sets
- problem: there are 2 for each analysis (initial values the system can be in when it starts - referred to as I, 
           convex set describing the free input - referred to as U). In which format are they given to the reachability Analysis?
- solution: will be given as structs containing matrix_t, vector_t, operator_t (consistent with e.g. guard descriptions). 
            Each struct describes a closed convex set.

2) <, > Operators
- problem: processing convex sets using strict comparison operators < and >, e.g. determining 
           the intersection of a guard with a polyheder with < constraints
- solution:
- workaround: assume for the moment there are only <=, >= and == comparison operators used

3) Valuations
- todo: check if they are still contained in the hybrid automaton implementation (should not)

4) Flow descriptions Ax + b
- problem: reachability algorithm needs to know which dimensions of A2x (equivalent to Ax +b) are the new introduced dimensions
- solution: 
- todo: implement the transformation and store the required information (relates to the general input format used and to be discussed)

5) Output
- problem: What should the reachability algorithm return?
- solution: polyheder objects would be nice

6) Internal Polyheder representation
- note: the already available polyheder representation can be used as it works with both H and V representations and offers already 
        some operations on polyheders

7) sin and cos with Float_T
- todo: check if there are still unused old files related to Float_t in the HyPro repository
