# Examples {#examples}

Here we list and shortly describe the example files shipped with HyPro. Each file can be build by using the
corresponding cmake target (which is equivalent to the file name without suffix), i.e., to build the example about
boxes, run:

    make example_box

Note that each file inside the folder `examples/` which is prefixed with `example_` is automatically converted into a
cmake target.

## Included examples
