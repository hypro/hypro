 * @brief   Class implementing a worker for automata with urgent transitions.
 * @details Implements methods for computing time elapse and discrete transitions.
 *          Repeated calling of these methods allows implementation of reachability analysis.
 *          The worker can optionally deal with urgent transitions by either computing a convex overapproximation
 * 					of the set difference with the jump enabling set or by computing the set difference, which can lead
 * 					to multiple segments for a single point in time. The refinement level for each transition is set
 * 					in the given task.
