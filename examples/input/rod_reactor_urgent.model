# Modified model of a reactor core found for example in "The Algorithmic Analysis of Hybrid Systems".
# One of two cooling rods can be inserted to cool down the core. If the temperature gets too high and no rods can be inserted, the system is unsafe.
# Rods can only be inserted every 20 seconds.

# Adaptions: Insertions of cooling rods are urgent. Therefore the guards c1 >= 20 and c2 >= 20 can be removed from the jump to cooling locations, which makes
# handling urgency necessary for verifying safety.
# The initial set has been modified from [510,520]x[20,20]x[20,20] to [510,510]x[20,20]x[20,20]
# Since hypro does not support strict inequalities, the unsafe condition x >= 550 c1 < 20 c2 < 20 is approximated by x >= 550.1 in location norod
